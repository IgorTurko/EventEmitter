# Emitter

Implementation of an `Emitter` module. The implementation must include the following functions:
* `off`
* `on`
* `once`
* `trigger`

For more information about the API, see `specification.md`.

## Purpose
The purpose of the task is to use:

* git commands, such as `git clone`
* Node.js commands, such as e.g. `npm test`
* [`babel`](https://babeljs.io) (also, to understand the concept of "transpiling" from ES2015+ to ES5)
* [`Karma`](https://karma-runner.github.io) for testing JavaScript code


## Requirements
To run the Emitter, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) `v6.4.0`+ installed (either system-wide or through [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or similar). No global modules are required as all the necessary modules are locally installed.
